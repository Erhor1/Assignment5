Project overview:
       This project utilises the IBM's Watson AI to produce a facial recognition program. The 
program takes an image as input. The image is then uploaded to Watson computer and the AI can 
recognise faces in the image, their gender, age, and position of the face. The result is output to the 
user both in text and audio. In addition, the program can also point out the position of the faces in 
the photo.
